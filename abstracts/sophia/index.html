<p><strong>Sophia Frangou</strong></p>
		Neuroimaging has had a transformative effect in psychiatry as it has established that psychiatric disorders have brain-based correlates.  Initial expectations were that neuroimaging studies would uncover disorder-specific biomarkers. However, meta- and mega-analyses of the substantial body of neuroimaging literature on structural and functional brain metrics has identified significant overlap across disorders that cannot be explained by diagnostic misclassification alone.  The National Institutes of Mental Health promoted the use of brain circuit-based analyses, embedded within the Research Domain Criteria framework, as a tool for the identification of circuit-specific disorder or symptom associations. Results to date have not provided evidence of such specificity. Similarly multivariate analyses using a variety of approaches have not been successful in producing robust predictive models for diagnosis or prognosis. This presentation will provide a critical synthesis of this literature and discuss proposals for reframing the role of neuroimaging in psychiatry.
