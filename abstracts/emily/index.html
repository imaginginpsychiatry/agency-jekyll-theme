    <h2 class="section-heading">Clinical Translation of Psychiatric Neuroimaging</h2>

<p><strong>Emily Stern</strong></p>
		Since ancient times, humans have tried to understand the origins of thoughts and feelings.  With the relatively recent advent of functional neuroimaging methods, it has become possible to examine the neural circuit function underlying perception, cognition, emotion and behavior. Importantly, these tools can also be used to begin to understand how these brain systems go awry in neuropsychiatric disorders.  Over the past 20+ years, a tremendous body of literature has emerged that has shed light on these issues; however, the translation of this neurobiological knowledge and the associated methodologies into clinically useful tools has remained elusive.  This talk will focus on advances that will lead to a new, evidence-based neuroimaging solution that can guide psychiatric patient care, using a personalized medical approach.
