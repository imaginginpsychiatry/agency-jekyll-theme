			The development of real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) has expanded the reach of neurofeedback for self-regulation training of brain activity. Over the last 15 years there have been increasing efforts to utilise fMRI-neurofeedback in neurorehabilitation and psychiatry. I will describe the rationale for its use as a therapeutic tool in psychiatry, focusing on our development of protocols for depression and alcohol dependence. I will provide a taxonomy of clinical neurofeedback paradigms and review the current state of clinical evidence, including the recent results of the BRAINTRAIN consortium (www.braintrainproject.eu). I will go on to discuss how clinical fMRI-neurofeedback can be taken to the next level, focussing on questions of protocol and trial design. I will argue that neurofeedback treatment needs to incorporate elements of psychological therapies and transfer technologies in order to become a clinically viable therapy.‚Äù
