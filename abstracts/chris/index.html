    <h2 class="section-heading">Intensified rTMS treatment for depression: insights from brain imaging</h2>

<p><strong>Chris Baeken</strong></p>
			Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has been put forward as a valid treatment intervention for depressed patients. To optimize stimulation parameters new rTMS protocols quickly evolve. Brain imaging research may not only be of interest to understand its working mechanisms in the depressed state, but it may also be used to improve response and remission rates in such patients.
