<p><strong>Hilleke Hulshoff Pol</p>
			  Mental disorders have consistently formed more than 14% of age-standardized years lived with disabilities for nearly three decades, and have greater than 10% prevalence in all 21 Global Burden of Diseases regions.<sup>1</sup> Precision medicine is what is called for to improve diagnostics and therapeutics. Developing such approaches depends on sophisticated integration of clinical data with other patient information, including data from neuroimaging, and on genetic make-up and environmental adversity, to uncover disease subtypes and improve the accuracy with which patients are categorized and treated.<sup>2</sup> For brain imaging, this requires large-scale, high quality brain image acquisition in individuals during development and ageing, fast quantification of images allowing further data processing, and input from clinical data. Using such approaches, we find overlapping and differentiating brain changes with increased risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.<sup>3</sup> Moreover, in a longitudinal pattern recognition study in adults<sup>4</sup> we find that there is accelerated brain aging in schizophrenia that may not only elucidate various factors influencing brain changes in schizophrenia, but also assist in individualizing treatment. How brain imaging can contribute to precision psychiatry will be further discussed.
