    <h2 class="section-heading">Across-nosology data bases and machine learning for auditory biomarkers</h2>

<p><strong>Klaus Mathiak</strong></p>
		The Psychiatric Imaging Network Germany provides a database for neuroimaging data from the 9 research networks on mental health funded by the BMBF.  The longitudinal MRI data comprise the most prevalent psychiatric diagnosis (e.g., schizophrenia, substance abuse, affective, personality and developmental disorders) with different modalities (structural, diffusion-weighted and functional) with pragmatic common procedures and quality assurance.  I will demonstrate and discuss this infrastructure and exemplify machine learning application to trans-nosological analyses with a focus on auditory biomarkers.
