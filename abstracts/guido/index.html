    <h2 class="section-heading">Neuroimaging for treatment outcome prediction in psychiatry</h2>

<p><strong>Guido van Wingen</strong></p>
		A central aim of the field is to develop biomarkers that could enable personalization of treatment in psychiatry. In recent years, neuroimaging markers have been detected that can predict treatment outcome at an individual level with high accuracy. The driving force behind this is the use of multivariate analysis of neuroimaging data using machine learning methods. In this presentation, I will first provide a short introduction about machine learning for neuroimaging. Thereafter, I will present studies in which we have detected neuroimaging markers that can predict treatment outcome for mood and anxiety disorders, from first-line cognitive behavioral therapy to last-resort electroconvulsive therapy. Finally, I will discuss how these neuroimaging biomarkers could be used to shorten treatment trajectories, and thereby reduce patient burden and reduce societal costs.
